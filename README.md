This is an Enigma Machine emulator written in Go during my spare time.

The Enigma Machine was an electro-mechanical rotor cryptography device used by the Germans in WWII to massive effect. The enigma machine used a series of rotors, reflectors, and plugs in order to create a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher with approximately 158 million million million different configurations. In order to use the machine, soldiers would configure their machines to a pre-agreed upon configuration which changed on a daily basis. After that, soldiers would type their message into the machine and then send the encrypted version of this message over radio broadcast. On the receiving end, soldiers would type the encrypted message into their own enigma machine (set to the same daily configuration) and receive the unencrypted message back.
